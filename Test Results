Overall, LightSort performs better that the normal Quicksort. A simple test shows that for a million 
randomized numbers(range 0~1000), LightSort leads by 31 seconds. 
The algorithm was implemented in python for readabilty but can be adapted to other laguage for more efficient and stable performance.
